# Applied Visual Design

## text-align

Controls how text is aligned in it's element.

`left`, `right` and `center` work as expected.

`justify` makes all lines except the last meet the left and right edges of the element.

```css
    text-align: center;
```

## width

`width` values can be supplied as relative (`em`), absolute (`px`) or as a percentage of it's containing parent.

```css
img{
  width: 220px;
}
```

## height

Likewise, with the `height` element property.

```css
h4{
    height: 25px;
}
```
