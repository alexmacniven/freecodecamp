# Basic CSS

## Introduction

CSS allows the developer to control;
 - colour
 - fonts
 - positioning
 - spacing
 - sizing
 - decoration
 - transition

There are 3 ways to apply CSS;
 1. Directly to the HTML element using the `style` attribute
 2. Using `<style>` in the HTML document
 3. Externally, then reference the .css file in the HTML document

Option 3 is the preferred method as it seperates content and style.
It also allows the style to be changed without modifying the content and structure specified by the HTML file.

With CSS a HTML element in the DOM (Document Object Model) is targetted and a variety of it's attributes are changed.

## Change the Color of Text

Use an elements `style` attribute to change it's color.
Note the `;` when closing the string attribute, this is good practice.

This is an example of basic inline CSS.

```html
<h2 style="color: red;">CatPhotoApp</h2>
```

## Use CSS Selectors to Style Elements

Imagine having to do that ðŸ‘† for *each* HTML element, large projects would soon become unmanagable.
Luckily we can use a `<style>` block and specify attributes for HTML elements like `h2` using selectors.

```html
<style>
  h2 {
    color: blue;
  }
</style
```
Note the syntax of the style block, each selector is opened and closed with braces.

## Use a CSS Class to Style an Element

Use classes to add resuable styles across HTML elements.
A common case is where we don't want *all* `h2` elements to be red.
Create a class and all elements with the specified class will use it's declarations.

```html
<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>
```
Note: all CSS classes start with `.` e.g. `.red-text`.
But we omit the `.` when the HTML element is referencing the class.

## Use an id Attribute to Style an Element

Like classes, they can be used to style with CSS.
An `id` is not resusable, it can only be used on a single element.
However it does have a higher importance than a class; if an element has an `id` and a `class` then the `id` declaration will take priority.
When specifying an `id` declaration in the CSS, start them with a `#`

```html
<style>
  #cat-photo-form {
    background-color: green;
  }
</style>
```

## Adjust the Padding of an Element

Elements are essentially recangles on a canvas.
There are three important elements that can be used to control the space around an element; `padding`, `margin` and `border`.

`padding` controls the space between the elements content and the border

```html
<style>
  .injected-text {
    margin-bottom: -25px;
    text-align: center;
  }

  .box {
    border-style: solid;
    border-color: black;
    border-width: 5px;
    text-align: center;
  }

  .yellow-box {
    background-color: yellow;
    padding: 10px;
  }

  .red-box {
    background-color: crimson;
    color: #fff;
    padding: 20px;
  }

  .blue-box {
    background-color: blue;
    color: #fff;
    padding: 10px;
  }
</style>
<h5 class="injected-text">margin</h5>

<div class="box yellow-box">
  <h5 class="box red-box">padding</h5>
  <h5 class="box blue-box">padding</h5>
</div>
```
![element with 10px padding][element_10_padding]

```html
<style>
    .blue-box {
    background-color: blue;
    color: #fff;
    padding: 10px;
  }
</style>
```
![element with 20px padding][element_20_padding]
